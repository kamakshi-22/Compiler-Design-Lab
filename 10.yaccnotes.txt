YACC (yet another compiler-compiler) is an LALR(1) (LookAhead, Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation producer with 1 lookahead token) parser generator.

A parser generator is a program that takes as input a specification of a syntax, and produces as output a procedure for recognizing that language.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax :

/* definitions */
 ....

%% 
/* rules */ 
....
%% 

/* auxiliary routines */
.... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling YACC program :

Write lex program in a file file.l and yacc in a file file.y
    For yacc file : 
        define head filename
        accept token generated
        specify order of procedure
        transition rules
        parse by calling yyparse()
        print result

Open Terminal and Navigate to the Directory where you have saved the files. 
type lex file.l 
type yacc file.y 
type cc lex.yy.c y.tab.h -ll 
type ./a.out 

$$ stands for the result of the current rule. $1 and $3 stand for the results of the first and third components respectively. So in this case, $1 would hold the value of the left num token and $3 of the right one.
